# basicwebsite

This is a very basic web site I did for web design class....just has basic html, css, jquery and PHP

To use, open the DBopen.inc.php in the includes folder and give it the username password and database name exsisting on your system.

Run setup.php in the main folder...all parts should read success after them

Then index.php will work.
